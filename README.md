# C-Code-for-Kani-s-method-
C++ program to implement Kani's method for structural analysis of beams. The program takes input parameters such as beam length, support conditions and position, and external loads, and output the reactions at supports and section forces (axial forces, shear forces, and moments) for each section of the beam.

## Motivation:-
Doing by hand calculations can be time consuming as well as incur human error due to confusion if the problem is too complicated. So, I wish to develop a program to aid in the calculation process.

## Scope:-
● The program will be implemented for beams.
● The program will be compatible with a uniformly distributed load through a section and single concentrated load through a section.
Note:- Here section is defined as the span between two consecutive supports.

Following are the kind of beams for which the program would be suitable:-
